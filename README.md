# fredlib-updated
FRED is a machine reader for the Semantic Web: it is able to parse natural language text in 48 different languages and transform it to linked data. It is implemented in Python and available as REST service and as a Python library suite (fredlib). This repo is just my updated, derivative of it for Python 3.12 clients.
